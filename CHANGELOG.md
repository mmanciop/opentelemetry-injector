### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `injector`: Replace the C-based OpenTelemetry injector with an injector written in Zig, donated by Dash0. (#230)
  This new injector will be the foundation for future enhancements of LD_PRELOAD based auto-instrumentation.
  It replaces the current injector (written in C) with its setenv-based approach with a new injector (written in Zig)
  that overrides getenv.
  The previous injector was built in a way that binds to a libc. This works when the injector is distributed as an RPM
  or DEB package, but is not suitable for instrumenting workloads on systems where the libc flavor (glibc or musl)
  is not known ahead of time, e.g. instrumenting arbitrary Kubernetes workloads.
  Furthermore, the new injector behaves more gracefully when the environment variable that is to be injected (e.g.
  JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, or NODE_OPTIONS) is already present, as it merges existing options with the key-value pairs it
  injects.
  Since this change is a complete rewrite, it is marked as a breaking change.
