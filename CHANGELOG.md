<!-- next version -->

## v0.2.0-20251216

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `systemd`: Remove systemd instructions (#68)
  We can remove systemD instructions as the LD_PRELOAD solution works just as well and applies to any software.
  

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `injector`: Adds support for selectively applying instrumentation to subset of programs running on a system (#84)
  The change allows users to implement filters on what to instrument based on the executable name and the command line arguments
- `environment`: Add option to pass custom environment variables to agents (#82)
  Now it is possible to pass custom environment variables to agents.
  
  New `all_auto_instrumentation_agents_env_path` configuration option is used to specify path to
  the `auto_instrumentation_env.conf` - where custom environment variables could be specified.
  Injector will pass these variables to agents.
  

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `nodejs`: test nodeJS support (#127)
  Testing identified issues with the RPM and Debian packages.
  The Debian and RPM packages now contain the nodeJS dependencies organized in a folder structure rather than an archive.
  The configuration points correctly to the file to load to launch autoinstrumentation.
  
  NodeJS tests now run as part of CI.

## v0.0.1-20251030

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `injector`: Replace the C-based OpenTelemetry injector with an injector written in Zig, donated by Dash0. (#230)
  This new injector will be the foundation for future enhancements of LD_PRELOAD based auto-instrumentation.
  It replaces the current injector (written in C) with its setenv-based approach with a new injector (written in Zig)
  that overrides getenv.
  The previous injector was built in a way that binds to a libc. This works when the injector is distributed as an RPM
  or DEB package, but is not suitable for instrumenting workloads on systems where the libc flavor (glibc or musl)
  is not known ahead of time, e.g. instrumenting arbitrary Kubernetes workloads.
  Furthermore, the new injector behaves more gracefully when the environment variable that is to be injected (e.g.
  JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, or NODE_OPTIONS) is already present, as it merges existing options with the key-value pairs it
  injects.
  Since this change is a complete rewrite, it is marked as a breaking change.
