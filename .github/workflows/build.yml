      # TODO I think we should split the build-package job at this point. Everything above is independent of SYS_PACKAGE.
      # In particular the make injector-integration-tests-for-one-architecture ARCH=${{ matrix.ARCH }} step is not
      # super cheap and right now we are running it twice for each CPU arch, once for deb and once for rpm, although
      # it is independent of SYS_PACKAGE. The remaining steps below should be a separate job (named build-and-upload
      # package) and the steps above should be a job named run-tests or verify or something like that.
      # However, I'll leave that to a separate follow up PR.
